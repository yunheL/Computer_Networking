###Question about assignment description
1. So the size of <length> i.e. length of variable payload should stay the same for each test? (thus we can control the transmission rate by using the variable <rate> i.e number of packets per second)

2. The print out for blaster:
seq# payload(4 byte) <-on the same line
echo seq# payload(4 byte) <- on the same line
Is this correct? Is seq# and payload(4 bit) on the same line?
